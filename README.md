# python-priorityqueue

Priority queue implementation based on the one in the Python heapq
docs at https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html

I wrote this because there wasn't an actual priority queue class ready
off the shelf in the Python standard library. It is very much the
documentation example with some pretty wrapping around it to make it
"import-ready".

Maybe this'll save you a few minutes instead of redoing it yourself.
